  <h2> hypersexualization of young girls </h2>
  <p class="introduction">
    sexuality that is inappropriately imposed on girls through media, marketing or products directed at them that encourages them to act in adult sexual ways.</p>
<div class="description">
  <p class="paragraph"> The sexualization and fetishization of young girls has been so deeply immersed into pop culture and media, that it has become a normalized and accepted facet of American society.
    Schools are still teaching girls, as young as 5 years old, that their bodies do not belong to them. Social media affects and pressures growing females to conform to sexuality standards and body images. Pornography websites still support pedophilic predators and give young teens severely toxic and destructive expectations for future sexual experiences.
    Throughout their early education, female students are often given strict dress code restrictions on tank tops and the permission of shorts, but only if they are at knee-length or longer. These pointless, highly-detailed regulations imply that female dress codes are not necessarily enforced to avoid disrupting classroom atmospheres, but rather to avoid disrupting the attention of male classmates.

    Faculty and school districts that force girls to cover their legs and shoulders to preserve the attention of their male peers, subliminally reinforce the notion that young girls’ clothing choices must be made for the benefit of male student’s education, instead of their own comfortability or confidence.

    Rather than treating young girls as sexual distractions and reprimanding them for wearing provocative clothing, schools should instead hold sexual assault and harassment seminars to teach boys to respect their female classmates’ bodies.
